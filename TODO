* Move widget->x and widget->y to containter widgets as x_off and y_off

* Unify widget int events

* Widget int subclasses?

* Disabled widgets?

* Shall we filter mouse clicks & touch events if the coordinates are outside of
  the widget? Many widgets do that in their event handlers anyways

* Key Repeat events for buttons?
